NodeJS Fitocracy Module

Uses Zombie to scrape fitocracy for different feeds...

Some of the data on the website isn't output as json files (from what I can tell), so I have to parse it using cheerio.

##TODO:

* ~~Get List of Activities~~
* ~~Get Activity by ID~~
* ~~Parse Get User Quests (which is not json)~~
* ~~Parse User Achievements (which is not json)~~
* ~~Get User Friends~~
* ~~Get List of Workouts~~
* ~~Get Workout on Date~~
* ~~Get Workout Between Dates~~
* ~~Get Stream (? I don't know what this is... but it's json)~~
* ~~Get User Points~~
* Get Activity Stream (which is not json)... somewhat duplicative of list of activities...
* Get Feed  (which is not json)
